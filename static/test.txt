The greatest names in American history are those of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. 
These two men are great in the true sense of the word; they are great because they loved their country, 
purely and passionately, better than themselves, and gave their lives to its service. 
They thought nothing of their own honour and glory: to the last they were simple and true. 
Americans may well be proud of two such patriots; and from them every one may be glad to learn what real greatness means. 
Their work has made America what it is.

Less than forty years before Abraham Lincoln was born, America belonged to England. 
In the time of Charles I., numbers of people who loved freedom and hated the wrongful government of the king left their 
country and sailed to the New World. Samuel Lincoln was one of these men.

For a long time they were few in number. The greatest part of the country was unknown forest, inhabited by wild beasts, 
or vast plains which belonged to fierce tribes of Red Indians. Life for the early settlers was very hard and rough. 
They had to cut down trees to build their houses, and to kill wild animals to get their food. Nevertheless they 
soon grew to love the country where they lived, where they married and brought up their children; and their wild open 
life made freedom more precious to them than anything else. They began to resent the action of the English Government,
 which wanted to tax them to pay for wars which were agreed upon in the Parliament in London, where America had no voice to speak for her.
 On July 4, 1776, in the reign of George III., the chief citizens met together and declared that America was a free united country,
 with a right to govern itself. The 4th of July—“Independence Day”—is the greatest day of all in America.

For seven years there was war. In this war Abraham’s great-grandfather, John Lincoln, served as a soldier.
 The Americans were led by George Washington.

England was defeated, and America—the United States of America—was a free country. From this time on, America 
belonged to the Americans. But a great many years had to pass before they made of the country the America that we know.
 Now there are towns everywhere: you can get from one end to the other of the great country, far bigger than the whole of Europe,
 by trains that travel day and night from north to south and east to west. Then there were very few towns, most of them along the coast,
 and no railways. All the west was unknown.

After the war was over, bands of explorers set out to fight the Indians and to find new homes for themselves. 
And Abraham Lincoln’s grandfather, after whom he was named, was one of the first of these explorers. 
He sold his little piece of land in Virginia, and tramped through the forests till he found a place to build a new home,
 carrying his youngest son Thomas on one shoulder, and with his loaded rifle in his other hand ready to shoot any Indian 
who should attack him. In Kentucky some white men had already settled and built a small fort; near it Lincoln cut down trees
and built a hut for himself and his wife and his three sons to live in.
